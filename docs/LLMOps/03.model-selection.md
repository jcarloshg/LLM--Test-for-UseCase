# Phase 3: Model Selection & Evaluation

## Objective

- Evaluate different LLM options to find the best fit for your use case by testing on your specific data.
- Consider model size, cost per request, latency, capabilities, and whether to use proprietary APIs (GPT-4, Claude) or open-source models (Llama, Mistral).

## Key Activities

- Compare models on evaluation dataset
- Test both proprietary and open-source options
- Measure performance metrics relevant to use case
- Evaluate cost per request and latency
- Document model comparison in decision matrix

## Tools

- **LiteLLM** - Unified interface for 100+ LLMs
- **OpenRouter** - Single API for multiple providers
- **Weights & Biases** - Experiment tracking

## Outputs

- Model comparison report with scores
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Latency benchmarks
- Selected model with justification

## Challenges

- **Benchmark fallacy:** Choosing models based on public benchmarks instead of testing on your actual use case.
- **Cost surprises:** Not accounting for production-scale token usage.
- **Vendor lock-in:** Over-committing to one provider without fallback options.
